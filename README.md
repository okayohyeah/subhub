# Subhub - In Development
## A Hybrid React Native App - Web and Mobile

A place for substitute teachers to track and organize assignments. 
* Star/Flag positive or difficult assignments with personal notes on: lesson plans, teacher expectations, students, administration, schedule, and extra duty, which would enhance your ability to do your job. 
* A way to filter past assignments quickly because once assignments are posted, one has to decide immediately. 
* This app offsets the time pressure.
